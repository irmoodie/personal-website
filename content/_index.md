# Hello!

I'm Iain, a biologist driven by a desire to understand the world around me. I spent my undergraduate studies hopping between Scotland and Sweden, during which I developed a passion for Ecology, Evolution and Entomology. I further sought to gain a diverse skillset that has primed me perfectly for continuing in the field as a researcher. During my final year, I recognised that evolutionary dynamics were what peaked my interest, but I lacked a strong background in evolutionary theory to fully appreciate and develop new research questions in the field. Addressing this keen interest and incomplete background became the focus of my postgraduate search, which resulted in me accepting a place on the Erasmus Mundus Master Programme in Evolutionary Biology ([MEME](https://www.evobio.eu/)).

I am currently taking courses from the Evolutionary Biology Master's at Uppsala University, Sweden. In the spring I will move to France to continue my studies at the University of Montpellier.

I am searching for potential supervisors and one semester research projects for 2021/22 in the field of Evolutionary Biology. If you know of any opportunities please get in touch. You can find links to my CV, portfolio and research interests above.
