I'm Iain, a biologist driven by a desire to understand the world around me. I spent my undergraduate studies hopping between Scotland and Sweden, during which I developed a passion for Ecology and Evolution. I further sought to gain a diverse skillset that has primed me perfectly for continuing in the field as a researcher. During my final year, I recognised that eco-evolutionary dynamics were what peaked my interest, but I lacked a strong background in evolutionary theory to fully appreciate and develop new research questions in the field. Addressing this keen interest but incomplete background became the focus of my postgraduate search, which resulted in me accepting a place on the Erasmus Mundus Master Programme in Evolutionary Biology ([MEME](https://www.evobio.eu/)).

I have finished my first semester at Uppsala University and have moved to France where I am continuing my studies at the University of Montpellier. Soon, I will begin an internship with [Fronhofer Lab](https://www.emanuelfronhofer.net/) at the Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution [(ISEM)](http://www.isem.univ-montp2.fr/) researching the evolution of the temperature niche.
