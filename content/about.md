Hi! I'm Iain. And I am driven by a desire to understand the world around me.

That desire took me to the University of Stirling, where I recently graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Animal Biology. The experiences, knowledge, skills and friends I gained during my studies have vastly broadened my understanding of the natural world and continues to generate new questions, seemingly exponentially. This collection of ever expanding queries, that in past had seemed frustrating, is now what excites me the most. I am drawn to the questions that arise in Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour and, more often than not, the intersection between all three.

Aside from this, I love to travel. I love it most when I can live somewhere for a while, where I don't feel the rush to "see it all" in the time I am there, and instead can spend hours simply wandering around cities, hiking through the country, lounging in caf√©s and reading in parks. To this end, I have endeavored to make myself as mobile as I can, and currently have all my belongings in a single backpack (incl. a very essential foldable insect net). 

While considering what I should do once I had finished my undergraduate, I came across a programme that was perfect. And I am very happy (and super excited!) to say that I will begin my Master's studies as part of the [MEME programme](https://www.evobio.eu/), the Erasmus Mundus Master's Programme in Evolutionary Biology. In August, I move to Uppsala for the first semester.

Currently I am in Austria working on some very summer 2020 appropriate projects (read: entirely laptop based). I miss fieldwork.
