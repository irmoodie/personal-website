Hi! I'm Iain. I'm a biologist from Scotland and I am driven by a desire to understand the world around me.

That desire took me to the University of Stirling, where I recently graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Animal Biology. The experiences, knowledge, skills and friends I gained during my studies have vastly broadened my understanding of the natural world and continues to generate new questions, seemingly exponentially. This collection of ever expanding queries, that in past had seemed frustrating, is now what excites me the most. I am drawn to the questions that arise in Evolution, Ecology and Behaviour and, more often than not, the intersection between all three.

I have begun my Master's studies as part of the [MEME programme](https://www.evobio.eu/) and I am currently (remotely) studying at the University of Uppsala :sweden:
