## The ENDORSE Project

For my undergraduate dissertation, I conducted an experiment that aimed to quantify and assess the adaptive significance of the behaviour of an agricultural pest (*Helicoverpa armigera*) post-inoculation of a fungal bio-pesticide. I developed a method of accurately measuring the quantity of food consumed by an individual larvae, allowing me to model both survival and changes in food intake (infection induced anorexia) over time with the strength of bio-pesticide application. This work was imbedded within and highly complimented the ongoing ENhancing Diversity to Overcome ReSistance Evolution ([ENDORSE](https://enhancingdiversity.wixsite.com/endorse)) project at the University of Stirling

## Svensson Lab

Between academic years, during the summers of 2018 and 2019, I worked as a research intern in [Erik Svensson's](https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/persons/erik-svensson(0b06c1e4-a124-406a-8ac5-cce4f8fc66d6).html) Lab at Lund University, Sweden. I worked closely with [Stephen De Lisle](https://www.spdelisle.com/) and [Miguel GÃ³mez](http://mgomezllano.com/) on a number of projects exploring sexual selection, local adaptation and species coexistence using damselflies as a study system. In 2019, I was invited to return to again contribute to the fieldwork but also to independently manage mesocosms that were setup the previous year.

## Cromarty Firth Fishery Trust

Prior to my degree, I worked and volunteered as a research assistant with the [Cromarty Firth Fishery Trust](https://cromarty.dsfb.org.uk/publications-2/), a charitable body with the objective of promoting and undertaking research of the fresh water fishery resources and associated habitats in the area of the Cromarty Firth (Highland, Scotland). During my time working with the CFFT, I was part of an electro-fishing team that would survey local river systems for monitoring purposes, including radio-tagging fish to better understand how they utilized the river system. We often worked closely with researchers at the University of Glasgow, collecting samples for [molecular studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.13857). I regularly conducted stream habitat assessments, measuring standardized abiotic and biotic factors, including sampling invertebrates and plant community surveys, as well as habitat restoration through *Rhododendron* removal and re-introducing stream heterogeneity.
